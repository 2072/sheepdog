Sheepdog
========

Useful to all classes this very simple add-on will prevent you from *accidentally* attacking crowd-controlled units.
Sheepdog will keep them safe from you!

Features:
---------

- It barks when you target a crowd-controlled unit.

- It warns you gently when a unit has been crowd-controlled somewhere nearby so you
  can be a little bit more cautious with your AOEs.

**Sheepdog doesn't bite!**
